## Module Execution Priority Map

```
Module 1 ─── Environment Setup
             Python 3.12 venv + pip install
                 │
Module 2 ─── Machine Learning Training
             Synthetic data → Random Forest → .joblib artifact
                 │
Module 3 ─── Flask REST API
             Health · Model-Info · Predict endpoints (Port 5000)
                 │
Module 4 ─── API Verification
             test_api.py → 4/4 automated integration tests
                 │
Module 5 ─── React + Vite Dashboard
             npm install → sliders, gauge, Recharts (Port 5173)
                 │
Module 6 ─── End-to-End System Test
             Browser verification across all tabs and presets
                 │
Module 7 ─── Dataset & Kaggle Comparative ML
             students.csv (253 rows) + Kaggle benchmark (215 rows)
                 │
Module 8 ─── Documentation & Viva Defense
             brain/ folder + README.md + teacher viva scripts
```

**Why this order matters**: The ML model artifact must exist before the Flask API boots. The API must be healthy before the React dashboard can fetch predictions. Running out of order is the most common setup failure.

## Module 1 — Python Environment Setup

**Priority**: First (all other modules depend on this)  
**Estimated time**: 3–6 minutes depending on internet speed

### Step 1.1 — Open a terminal and navigate to the backend folder

```powershell
cd backend
```

### Step 1.2 — Create an isolated Python 3.12 virtual environment

```powershell
python -m venv .venv
```

This creates a `backend/.venv/` folder with a clean Python interpreter. Global packages are not shared into this environment.

### Step 1.3 — Install all required packages

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```

**What gets installed**: Flask, Flask-CORS, NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Joblib, Requests.

**Expected output** (abbreviated):
```
Successfully installed Flask-3.1.3 flask-cors-6.0.5 numpy-2.5.4 pandas-3.0.6
scikit-learn-1.9.1 joblib-1.6.0 requests-2.34.2 ...
```

**Verification**: If the above line appears with no red errors, Module 1 is complete.

---

## Module 2 — Machine Learning Model Training

**Priority**: Second (must run before Flask API)  
**Estimated time**: 10–30 seconds

### Step 2.1 — Run the training script

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe train_model.py
```

### What the script does, in order

1. Calls `generate_synthetic_student_data(n_samples=2500)` — builds a realistic but fully synthetic student dataset using correlated normal distributions for scores and categorical distributions for projects, internships, certifications, and backlogs.
2. Splits the dataset 80% / 20% using stratified sampling so both classes are proportionally represented in both splits.
3. Trains a `RandomForestClassifier` with 250 trees, Gini impurity, max depth 12, balanced class weights, and a fixed random seed of 42 for reproducibility.
4. Evaluates the model on the 500-sample test split.
5. Serializes the trained model, feature names, thresholds, metrics, and feature importance into `placement_model.joblib`.

### Expected terminal output

```

## Module 3 — Flask REST API Server

**Priority**: Third  
**Estimated time**: 2–3 seconds to start

### Step 3.1 — Start the API server (keep this terminal open)

```powershell
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe app.py
```

### Expected terminal output

```
Starting LPU Placement Intelligence API on port 5000...
 * Serving Flask app 'app'
 * Debug mode: on
 * Running on http://127.0.0.1:5000
```

### Step 3.2 — Verify the health endpoint in your browser

Open: **http://127.0.0.1:5000/api/health**

Expected response:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "service": "LPU Placement Intelligence API",
  "model_loaded": true
}
```

### Available endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `/api/health` | GET | Confirm the server and model are running |
| `/api/model-info` | GET | View accuracy, ROC-AUC, and feature weights |
| `/api/predict` | POST | Submit a 9-field student profile, receive prediction |

**Important**: Do not close this terminal. The Flask server must stay running while you use the frontend dashboard.

## Module 4 — Automated API Verification

**Priority**: Fourth (verify backend before building frontend)  
**Estimated time**: 3–5 seconds

### Step 4.1 — Open a second terminal and run the test suite

```powershell
cd backend
.\.venv\Scripts\python.exe test_api.py
```

### What gets tested

| Test | Endpoint | Validates |
|---|---|---|
| Test 1 | `GET /api/health` | HTTP 200, model loaded |
| Test 2 | `GET /api/model-info` | HTTP 200, accuracy and ROC-AUC present |
| Test 3 | `POST /api/predict` (valid profile) | HTTP 200, score / gaps / recommendations returned |
| Test 4 | `POST /api/predict` (CGPA = 12.5, invalid) | HTTP 400, boundary violation correctly rejected |

### Expected output

```
=================================================================
   Running Automated Backend API Verification Tests
=================================================================
[TEST 1] GET /api/health -> Status: 200
[TEST 2] GET /api/model-info -> Accuracy: 91.00% | ROC-AUC: 0.9724
[TEST 3] POST /api/predict -> Score: 99 | Skill Gaps: 8 | Recommendations: 2
[TEST 4] POST /api/predict (Invalid CGPA) -> Status: 400 (Expected Error Caught)
=================================================================
   ALL API TESTS PASSED! Backend is ready and fully functional!
=================================================================
```

**If this passes**, the ML engine is serving correct predictions and rejecting invalid input. Proceed to Module 5.

### Common Viva Questions and Answers

**Q: Where did you get the datasets from?**  
A: Our project utilizes a 7-dataset repository covering 4,048 student records. Our primary model is trained on `students.csv` (253 records) capturing 9 actionable engineering competencies. To validate model generalizability, we incorporated 6 external benchmark datasets: Kaggle's 2,966-student engineering college placement dataset (`college_placement_engineering.csv`), Kaggle campus recruitment records (`campus_recruitment_kaggle.csv`), an engineering semester-by-semester coding language dataset (`engineering_skills_placement.csv`), standardized job features (`job_placement_features.csv`), a salary package regression dataset (`placement_package_salary.csv`), and cognitive IQ placement records (`placement_iq_academic.csv`). All datasets are 100% anonymized with zero PII.

**Q: Does a high readiness score guarantee placement?**  
A: No. The score is an uncalibrated diagnostic indicator generated by a model trained on simulated data. It identifies relative skill gaps and provides structured improvement guidance. Actual placement outcomes depend on institutional policies, company-specific criteria, interview performance, and economic conditions.

**Q: How is the prediction score calculated?**  
A: The Random Forest model's `predict_proba()` method returns the probability that a student profile belongs to the "placement ready" class. This probability is multiplied by 100 and rounded to produce the 0–100 readiness score.

**Q: What makes Random Forest suitable for this problem?**  
A: Random Forest handles mixed feature types (continuous CGPA/scores and discrete project/backlog counts) without scaling, is resistant to outliers, naturally produces feature importance rankings, and is robust to overfitting through ensemble averaging.

**Q: What is the difference between skill gaps and feature importance?**  
A: Feature importance (global) measures how much each feature contributed to the model's decisions across all 2,500 training samples. Skill gaps (individual) compare a specific student's values against predefined institutional benchmark thresholds and are rule-based, not model-derived.
